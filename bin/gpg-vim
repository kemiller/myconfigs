x
# This is a wrapper script to simplify editing of text files which are
# stored symmetrically encrypted with GnuPG.
# 
# Usage:
#
#   gpg-vim file.txt
#
# While editing the file is decrypted to a temporary location in the user's
# home directory. The script takes steps to ensure that any temporary files
# are readable and writable by the user, but noone else.  The file is then
# edited using vim.
#
# When the user has finished editing or viewing the contents of the file, 
# he or she is asked whether the updated contents should be encrypted and 
# saved back to the original location. Finally any temporary files are auto-
# matically removed.
#
# LIMITATIONS:
#
#   - The script will leave unencrypted files lying around in the user's
#     home directory if it terminates abnormally (e.g. by getting killed).
#
#   - Unencrypted data can obviously be stolen by the local superuser 
#     (or e.g. automated backup scripts) while the file is being edited.
#
#   - Supposedly "rm" isn't the most secure way to remove sensitive data.
#     The script attempts (somewhat weakly) to wipe all temporary files using
#     "dd" from /dev/urandom before deleting them, but this only affects 
#     files created by the script itself, not temporary files which may have 
#     been created by the editor (such as swap files used by vim).  Also, 
#     this is subject to limitations imposed by OS behavior (such as data 
#     journalling, filesystem snapshots, backups, etc.).
#
# The script was announced and discussed a little bit in my weblog, in
# this entry: http://bre.klaki.net/dagbok/faerslur/1105040646.shtml

# makes cleanup simpler and helps us catch (and wipe) automatic backups
